# Recommenders

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/badge/?version=latest)](https://microsoft-recommenders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## What's New (April, 2023)

We reached 15,000 stars!!

Our latest release is [Recommenders 1.1.1](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/releases/tag/1.1.1)! 

We have introduced a new way of testing our repository using [AzureML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/). With AzureML we are able to distribute our tests to different machines and run them in parallel. This allows us to test our repository on a wider range of machines and provides us with a much faster test cycle. Our total computation time went from around 9h to 35min, and we were able to reduce the costs by half. See more details [here](tests/README.md).

We also made other improvements like faster evaluation metrics and improving SAR algorithm. 

Starting with release 0.6.0, Recommenders has been available on PyPI and can be installed using pip! 

Here you can find the PyPi page: https://pypi.org/project/recommenders/

Here you can find the package documentation: https://microsoft-recommenders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Introduction

This repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:

- [Prepare Data](examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommender algorithm
- [Model](examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommender algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).
- [Evaluate](examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics
- [Model Select and Optimize](examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommender models
- [Operationalize](examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure

Several utilities are provided in [recommenders](recommenders) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [Recommenders documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).

For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create and activate a new conda environment
conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.9
conda activate <environment_name>

# Install the recommenders package with examples
pip install recommenders[examples]

# create a Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name <environment_name> --display-name <kernel_name>

# Clone this repo within vscode or using command:
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders.git

# Within vscode:
#   1. Open a notebook, e.g., examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb;

### Algorithm Comparison

We provide a [benchmark notebook](examples/06_benchmarks/movielens.ipynb) to illustrate how different algorithms could be evaluated and compared. In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.
